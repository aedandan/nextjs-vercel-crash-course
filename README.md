# Vercel, Next.js, & Sanity Crash Course
This project was my introduction to working with Next.js and Sanity.io's technology
at the same time as well as my first project deployed on the Vercel platform. If you are
curious about what the final result looks like, please [click through here.](https://nextjs-vercel-crash-course.vercel.app/)

Note that the majority of this code was derived from the following tutorials:
[The Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
[Tutorial: Make a blog with Next.js, React, and Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/blog/build-your-own-blog-with-sanity-and-next-js#9e1fb1526b04)
